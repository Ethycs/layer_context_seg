    "Project AURA focuses on transforming linear documents into knowledge graphs. This process involves disassembly, reconstruction, and reassembly. The core idea is to use percolation theory to determine optimal chunking strategies, ensuring a 15-30% overlap between segments for global connectivity.\n",
    "The system uses a language-guided processor. K-rules for disassembly define how to segment the text, for example, splitting at topic shifts or semantic boundaries. This is achieved by analyzing attention patterns from a transformer model.\n",
    "Once the graph is constructed, G-rules for reassembly are applied. These rules organize the graph's nodes, which represent the segments, into a new, coherent document. This allows for the creation of purpose-driven outputs like summaries or tutorials from the same underlying knowledge structure.\n",
    "A key challenge is handling long documents without exceeding GPU memory. The attention mechanism has a quadratic memory complexity, O(n^2), where n is the sequence length. To solve this, a sliding window approach is used. The document is processed in smaller, overlapping chunks, and the resulting attention matrices are stitched together to approximate the full document's attention patterns.\n",
    "This ensures that the system can scale to documents of any length while still leveraging the power of attention-based semantic analysis for high-quality segmentation and graph construction. The final output is a rich, interconnected knowledge graph that can be reassembled in various ways.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "## 🎯 Core Priming Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Structure Your Context Window Strategically**\n",
      "Put longform data at the top: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples. (from 16024 to 17581)\n",
      "Segment 6: This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models. Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Use XML Tags for Organization**\n",
      "Structure document content and metadata with XML tags: When using multiple documents, wrap each document in `<document>` tags with `<document_content>` and `<source>` (and other metadata) subtags for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "```xml\n",
      "<documents>\n",
      "  <document index=\"1\">\n",
      "    <source>transcript_001.txt</source>\n",
      "    <document_content>\n",
      "      {{TRANSCRIPT_CONTENT}}\n",
      "    </document_content>\n",
      "  </document>\n",
      "</documents>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## 🔧 Advanced Priming Techniques\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **The Pyramid Approach**\n",
      "Starting with broader, more general prompts allows the LLM to get a grasp of the overall context. As the conversation progresses, prompts can become more specific and pointed. This \"pyramid approach\" enables the LLM to establish a solid foundation before diving into the nuances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example progression:\n",
      "1. Start broad: \"What are the main themes in this document?\"\n",
      "2. Get specific: \"How does theme X relate to section Y?\"\n",
      "3. Go deep: \"Analyze the implications of Z within context of X and Y\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. (from 17581 to 18729)\n",
      "Segment 7: **Role-Based Priming**\n",
      "Priming chatbots involves crafting a prompt that sets the tone, style, or structure for the chatbot's responses. This technique allows users to adjust the AI's tone, guide its responses toward specific content, or introduce role-play to provide context.\n",

      "### 6. **Context Window Management Best Practices**\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure that the model receives clear, concise prompts that help it understand the task without ambiguity. This helps mitigate the risk of the model misinterpreting the context or focusing on the wrong elements of the input.\n",
      "\n",
      "For large transcripts:\n",
      "- **Chunk strategically**: Break into semantic units first\n",
      "- **Maintain coherence**: Include overlap between chunks\n",
      "- **Use markers**: Insert clear boundaries and relationships\n",
      "- **Progressive refinement**: Start with overview, then details\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Attention Management**\n",
      "Based on Liu et al, it appears that adding relevant context at the beginning or the end of a prompt improves the performance of LLMs, compared to including the relevant context in the middle of the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Structure your context like this:\n",
      "```\n",
