# Layered Context Graph System - Checkpoint

## Current Status (July 13, 2025)

We're enhancing the Layered Context Graph system to fully leverage attention mechanisms as described in the condensed architecture document. The system is designed to process long-context documents, segment them into meaningful partitions, extract attention patterns, build knowledge graphs, and save reorganized output.

## Completed Work

- Reviewed existing `attention_extractor.py` which provides:
  - Basic attention pattern extraction from transformer models
  - Support for both Hugging Face transformers and Ollama GGUF models
  - Head specialization discovery to identify what each attention head is good at
  - Natural language rule application to guide attention
  - Boundary detection and semantic clustering

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance Attention-Based Partitioning**
   - Implement the natural language rule specification approach
   - Add support for instruction seeding to guide attention heads
   - Implement percolation theory to ensure optimal window overlap (15-30%)

2. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Enhance graph building to better capture relationships between partitions
   - Implement the classification system (KEEP/DELETE/TRACK)
   - Add aggressive deduplication with configurable threshold

3. **Integrate with GPU Acceleration**
   - Leverage NVIDIA CUDA for accelerated inference
   - Optimize matrix operations for attention pattern analysis

4. **Reconstruct Documents from Graph**
   - Implement reverse reconstruction with programmatic attention
   - Ensure preservation of code samples and technical content
   - Support XML-based notebook output formatting

5. **Test and Validate**
   - Test with various document types (conversations, technical docs, code)
   - Compare performance of different model types
   - Validate attention mechanism effects on partitioning quality

## Technical Core Components

- **Head Specialization**: Automatically finding what each head is good at
- **Dynamic Head Selection**: Choosing different heads for different text types
- **Programmable Neural Reorganizer**: Describing segmentation and reorganization rules in natural language
- **Rule-Guided Attention**: Using natural language rules to shape how attention heads behave

## Architecture Insights

The system leverages a key insight: instead of hand-crafted rules, we can let the model learn what makes good boundaries/relationships using the same attention mechanism for both segmentation and reorganization. This makes the system interpretable (visualizing which heads make decisions) and adaptive (different heads for different content).

## GPU Support

The system runs in a dev container with NVIDIA CUDA libraries pre-installed, allowing for GPU acceleration of transformer models.
