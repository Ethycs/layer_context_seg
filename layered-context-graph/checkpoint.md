# Layered Context Graph Implementation Checkpoint

## Current Status
- Working on enhancing the attention extraction mechanism to load GGUF models into PyTorch
- Need to implement percolation-based context windows with 15-30% overlap
- Need to implement natural language rule specification for attention guidance

## Next Steps
1. **GGUF Loading Into PyTorch**
   - Enhance `ollama_extractor.py` to properly load GGUF files into PyTorch tensors
   - Extract attention patterns from the loaded model
   - Implement attention weight analysis

2. **Percolation Context Windows**
   - Update `context_window.py` to implement 15-30% overlap for optimal percolation
   - Add support for attention-based boundary detection

3. **Natural Language Rules**
   - Create an instruction seeder module
   - Implement rule-based attention biasing

4. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Build a graph structure from attention patterns
   - Implement node classification (KEEP/DELETE/TRACK)
   - Support graph reassembly for different output formats

## Key Concepts from Condensed Architecture
- Use attention patterns to identify segment boundaries
- Natural language rules can bias attention heads
- Percolation theory suggests 15-30% overlap is optimal for connectivity
- Graph representation enables flexible reorganization

## GPU Status
- NVIDIA GPU available for acceleration
- Will leverage CUDA for PyTorch tensor operations
