# Implementation Plan: Attention-Based Context Processing

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps to enhance the Layered Context Graph system with programmable attention mechanisms as described in the condensed architecture document.

## 1. Instruction Seeder Module

Create a new module that inserts natural language instructions into text to guide attention heads:

```python
class InstructionSeeder:
    def __init__(self, instruction_types=None):
        self.instruction_types = instruction_types or {
            "SEMANTIC": "Group by meaning",
            "SYNTACTIC": "Group by structure", 
            "TEMPORAL": "Group by time references",
            "PRIORITY": "Group by importance"
        }
    
    def seed_instructions(self, text, density=0.1):
        """Insert instruction markers throughout text"""
        # Implementation details
```

## 2. Natural Language Rule Processor

Enhance the existing `apply_natural_language_rules` method:

```python
def process_with_rules(self, text, seg_rule, reorg_rule):
    """Process text using natural language rules"""
    # Implementation details
```

## 3. Attention-Based Graph Builder

Create a module to build graphs from attention patterns:

```python
class AttentionGraphBuilder:
    def build_from_attention(self, attention_data, rules):
        """Build knowledge graph from attention patterns"""
        # Implementation details
```

## 4. Percolation-Optimized Context Windows

Enhance the `ContextWindow` class to support percolation theory:

```python
class PercolationContextWindow(ContextWindow):
    def __init__(self, size=8192, overlap_ratio=0.25):
        """Initialize with overlap ratio based on percolation threshold"""
        # Implementation details
```

## 5. CUDA Optimization

Add GPU acceleration support:

```python
def _initialize_model(self):
    """Load the model and tokenizer with GPU support"""
    # Implementation details
```

## 6. Testing Framework

Create tests to validate the enhanced attention mechanisms:

```python
def test_attention_guided_partitioning():
    """Test that natural language rules properly guide partitioning"""
    # Implementation details
```

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Implement instruction seeder and enhance natural language rule processor
2. **Week 2**: Implement attention-based graph builder and percolation-optimized context windows
3. **Week 3**: Add CUDA optimization and testing framework
4. **Week 4**: Integration testing and performance optimization

## Success Metrics

- **Partition Quality**: Improved coherence of partitions as measured by semantic similarity
- **Graph Connectivity**: Optimal connectivity between partitions (15-30% overlap)
- **Processing Speed**: 2x speedup through GPU acceleration
- **Flexibility**: Support for arbitrary natural language rules
