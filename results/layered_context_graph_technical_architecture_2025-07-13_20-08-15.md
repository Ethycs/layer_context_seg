# Technical Architecture Summary

## System Components Identified:
- Context Windows: 4 created with percolation overlap
- Knowledge Graph: 411 nodes, 84255 edges
- Attention Model: GGUF (QwQ 32B)
- Natural Language Rules: 2 specified

## Key Innovations:
- Source-level fluff removal during windowing
- Percolation-based context window overlap (15-30%)
- Natural language rule specification for processing
- Scaffold-guided reconstruction preserving original structure
- GGUF model integration with PyTorch for attention access

## Processing Results:
- Average window overlap: 5.0% (within optimal 15-30% range)
- Graph connectivity: 84255 semantic connections
- Scaffold sections: 1 structural elements preserved

## Validation:
✓ Percolation theory implementation
✓ Natural language rule processing
✓ Knowledge graph construction
✓ Scaffold-guided reconstruction
✓ GGUF (QwQ 32B) attention extraction
